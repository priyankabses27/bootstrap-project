# bootstrap-project
This project is a recreated version of the Lenskart website, built using HTML, CSS, and other front-end technologies. The design replicates the visual style, layout structure, and user interface components of the original Lenskart platform, showcasing skills in design-to-code conversion, responsive layout creation, and modern web styling.
